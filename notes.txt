github pages options
    if building for personal account repo (https:/github.username.io/)
        then dont include a baseurl
        can prefix links like /assets/...
        or as assets/... if you want to run site from _site
        can prepend baseurl if baseurl is blank
    else if building from normal repo (https:/github.username.io/repo_name) (with gh-pages branch)
        use a baseurl
        prefix like {{ /assets | prepend: site.baseurl }}

if you need different config for development and production (likely)
    put dev options also in _dev_config.yml and they will be overwriten
    bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload --config _config.yml,_dev_config.yml
