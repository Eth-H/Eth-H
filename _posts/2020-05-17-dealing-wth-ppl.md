advice on how to systematically deal with people

### starting a conversation
- relate
    - but try not to get to repetitive
    - while in conversation can probe for further talking points
- questions
    - not too direct
    - relaxed tone
    - if responses ask follow up questions, less yes/no answers
    - can share same info after a follow up question, making it easier for them to ask questions
    - if quick short answers, person is likely doesnt want to talk
- body language
    - become more approachable by smiling
    - make eye contact
        - if the person ignores eye contact, its likely they dont want to talk
        - sit infront of the person you want to talk to
    - other signs they dont want to talk
        - feet facing away

### dealing with anger
Its natural for people to get angry and most people will struggle to deal with their anger, espically if they are already having a bad day. And that anger can spread creating a depressing environment. Its important to be able to calm someone down, this will stop them losing their job.
- methods
    - divert attention from problem
    - calm solution to problem, if problem quickly solveable
    - offer a break, convince person to take break early
    - offer to talk if over
        - reduce counter attacks that may raise anger
    - find the source of anger
        - if you are the source of anger and its a minor problem, be sorry but try to remind them that they could lose their job in future
        - conflict between two people, try not to confront them both in public with a lack of info, suggest a possible solution to each person or remind them what really matters
        - if you are angry dont lash out, being angry will reduce performance and make it more difficult to solve to situation without more unwanted trouble

### taking ideas from workers
- if complaints try to clarify specifics
    - if its personal or conflict with anouther specific person/group, ask for permission to ask others first
    - dont pry to much, or may get exclued from the problem
- get opinions of the problem from other workers
- if small solve the problem yourself, otherwise take to management

### getting people to do what you want
It can be diffcult to convince someone to do a task, even if that task needs to be done for that individuals good.
- persuade them over telling them

    espically effective if you are younger or if you have the same/lower position, as people stick to their pride
    - ask them to do it
    - start the task yourself
        - this way if the person is afraid to do the task they can follow your lead
        - shows that you dont hold yourself high enougth to not do the task
- change persons perception of the task
    - give hints on how to complete the task easier
        - avoid too much info, seem like a rude know it all or confuse them
    - make the task seem easier
        this is to avoid an overwhelming hill, giving someone a list of long/difficult problems is very likely to de-motivate
        - break up the task into smaller manageable chunks
        - progessively disclosure advanced parts of the task
    - track progression
    - share the tasks purpose
    - rewards
        - highlight the process over the reward
        - avoid rewards separate from the activity itself

            this can reduce a persons desire to do something for the sake of of doing it, but can be effective if the activity is infrequent and boring

### raise motivation
- avoid pessimisum
    - encouraging statements on how things may get better
    - try and instead get people to work together to come up with a solution
